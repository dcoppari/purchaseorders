== Description ==

I wanted to make a simple to use plugin for add items to a list and send a purchase order

== Installation ==

1) Copy the purchase-orders folder to your wordpress plugin folder.

2) Activate the plugin and a new option will come up for settings.

3) Modify your code for adding a button to submit items to the cart, remember to add a hidden input tag named "cmd" with a "_cart" value.

	<form method='post' >
	  <input type='hidden' name='cmd' value='_cart'> <!-- This tell plugin to add to cart -->
	  <input type='hidden' name='item_name' value='Whatever you Want'>
	  <input type='hidden' name='item_number' value='SomeNumber'>
	  <input type='hidden' name='amount' value='10'>
	  <input type='hidden' name='quantity' value='1'>
	  <input type='hidden' name='add' value='1'>
	  <input type='submit' value='ADD TO CART'>
	</form>

4) If you want additional data to be sent on the e-mail add to the form's fields with "item_" prefix in the name attribute.

	  <input type='text' name='item_weight'>
